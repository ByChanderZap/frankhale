### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Frank Hale Develops](https://github.com/frankhale/frankhale/blob/master/frank-hale-develops.png)

From the time I was introduced to a Commodore 64 I instantly fell in love with software development. I think we are living in the golden age of software development. We have access to a seemlingly limitless knowledge base on the Internet and our tools are evolving at light speed. My passions right now are .NET Core/C# and Blazor. I'm also a huge fan of TypeScript and React. 

I'm looking to take my content creation to the next level by either streaming, creating videos or blogging about open source. I'm leaning on streaming but am still trying to decide what is right for me.
